      As a Senior Solutions Engineer at Microsoft, I work at the intersection of
      developer experience and artificial intelligence. I champion GitHub Copilot
      and AI-powered workflows to help engineering teams ship better software,
      faster. My passion lies in making complex technology feel intuitive and
      accessible.
